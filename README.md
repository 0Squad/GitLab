# Node + Grunt + Jasmine + node-inspector + nodemon demo

cd into the directory and do this:

```
npm install
```

Then try:

```
grunt debug
```

And behold the magic and utility.  (Hit C-c in the shell when you are tired of enchantment.)

```
grunt test
```

Edit the files in your editor of choice, fiddle with the logic, remove a semicolon or two, then try `grunt test` again.
